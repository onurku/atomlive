      title: "Wonderfully made",
      description:
        "Wonderfully Made is a picture book for children ages 5 – 10, the author shares her story and struggles of fitting in as a child immigrating to a new place. Along the way she met Indigenous friends and learned about their stories that helped transform her journey in embracing her own cultural roots.",
      story: {
        1: "As a little girl, my grandmother once asked me,<br/>”If you can choose your hair and eye colour, what would it be?”<br/>Naturally I said, ”Blonde and blue eyes,”  because that's how the dolls I played with looked like.",
        2: "I was 9 years old when my family decided to leave Hong Kong. So we packed all our belongings, boarded the airplane,and said goodbye to my birthplace and home for many years. I actually caught chickenpox earlier that week, but that did not stop us from immigrating to a place called Canada.",
        3: "On the plane, I felt like everyone was staring at my face because of the blemishes from the chickenpox! After a 13 hour flight, we finally arrived in Vancouver. But the welcome I received was a girl pointing at my face saying ”Eww, that's gross!” Embarrassed and tired, I just wanted to hide.",
        4: "Inside my empty room in our new home, I cried quietly, thinking about everyone I had left in Hong Kong, including my school friends, my two pet turtles, my relatives, and my dear grandparents.",
        5: "On the first day of school, even though I already knew some English, I was still nervous meeting my new classmates and teacher. Thankfully, I met a kind Malaysian-Chinese girl who was born in Canada. She showed me around the school and even spoke some Chinese to me. That was comforting for me and eventually, we became good friends.",
        6: "I quickly began to learn more English, adjusting to the new culture and trying to fit in. But sometimes my classmates would make fun of my lunch because it looked and smelled different from their lunch. In those moments I thought to myself, ”Why can‘t I just have a sandwich and juice box like everyone else?”",
        7: "I had a hard time adjusting to my new piano teacher because she taught in English, and I had to relearn all the musical terms. Also, she seemed scary to me because she did not smile much. At least her cat was cute and I enjoyed playing with it.",
        8: "In the school band, I began learning how to play the Western flute. But on the weekends, my parents also made me take Chinese flute lessons. There were times where I almost fainted from practicing both kinds of flutes.",
        9: "One Halloween, my brother and I dressed up as ancient Chinese warriors and we even carried fake swords for trick or treating. When my neighbours saw us they said ”Wow, those are really nice costumes!” Since I am Chinese, would this even be considered dressing up?",
        10: "A few years later, at school during recess, out of nowhere two girls shouted at me ”Hey, Chink!”<br/>Shocked and confused, I just froze and didn't know how to respond. Why would they treat me like this? I didn't do anything to them at all.",
        11: "As I grew up, sometimes I wished that I could just fit in better. My family insisted that I not lose my Chinese language and culture. But why? I don't need it here!",
        12: "One summer, when I was in university, I volunteered at a church where I led a small choir.<br/>There I met two First Nations grandmothers from the Blackfoot Nation. I was surprised that they already knew the song I was teaching them.",
        13: "The grandmothers had learned this song while they attended the Indian Residential Schools as children. They opened up and shared with me about the painful history of abuse that happened to them as kids.<br/>I was really shocked to learn that when they spoke in their own language or practiced their cultural ways, they would get punished.",
        14: "Later on when we sang songs and created music together, one of the grandmothers' daughters joined in by playing her traditional hand drum! I was amazed at her drumming and how joyful she was while playing it. Even though they went through so much, they were resilient and very proud of their own cultural roots. I began to wonder, ”how come I don't feel the same way about my own culture?”",
        15: "A few summers later, I had the chance to teach English to students in rural China, the homeland of my ancestors. I thought to myself, maybe the students would prefer someone who had blonde hair and blue eyes from North America to teach them. So I dyed my hair light brown and got some light coloured contacts for my eyes.",
        16: "To my surprise, the students became very close to me and treated me like a big sister because I knew the Chinese language and culture. They even took me to try some of the local street food. I was both amazed and a little scared when they invited me to try some super spicy rabbit meat hot pot.",
        17: "As we said goodbye, we shed many tears. When I read the farewell letters my students wrote to me in Chinese, I was so thankful that I could understand them. In this moment, I realized how precious it was to know my culture and language. How foolish of me to reject my own culture trying to be someone else. Embracing my culture helps me know how special I am. And who I am is wonderfully made!"

      1: "當我還是小孩子的時候，祖母曾經問我：<br/>”如果你可以選擇你頭髮和眼睛的顏色，會挑選什麼呢” 我很自然地說：「金頭髮和藍色的眼睛」因為我從小玩的洋娃娃都是這樣子的。",
      2: "當我九歲時我的家人收拾了全家的行李，一起坐飛機離開我的出生地和多年的家- 香港。 出發之前一星期我感染了水痘，但這並沒有阻止我們移民到加拿大。",
      3: "在飛機上我覺得別人都總是看著我臉上的水痘疤痕。經過十三小時的飛行之後，我們終於到達目的地，就是溫哥華。在機場有一個女孩子指著我的臉說：”哇，真醜啊!” 。這就是我獲得的歡迎。已經非常累又尷尬的我，當時只想躲起來。",
      4: "在新房子我空空的房間裡，我偷偷的流眼淚。我不停想著仍在香港學校裡的朋友，我心愛的兩隻寵物烏龜，還有我的親人和祖父母。",
      5: "在開學的第一天，雖然我會講一些英語，但是第一次要和新的同學和老師見面時，仍是覺得很緊張。幸好有一個在本地長大的馬來西亞華裔女同學帶我到處參觀校園，還和我說一些中文，這使我徬徨的心靈感到一些安慰。後來我們還成為了好朋友。",
      6: "我很快的開始學習更多英語，嘗試適應新的文化。但有時同學們會取笑我帶來學校吃的午餐，因為食物的外觀和氣味和其他人吃的很不同。在那一刻我想 “爲什麽我不可以像其他人一樣吃三明治和喝果汁盒了？”",
      7: "在學習中我覺得這裡的鋼琴課程更比較困難，因為它是以英語授課的；還要重新學習音樂中的英文術語。另外我也比較害怕新的音樂老師，因為她不是常有笑容。但至少她有一隻可愛的貓貓，下課之後我也喜歡去逗牠玩。",
      8: "在學校的樂隊中，我開始學習西洋長笛。在周末我父母要我學習中國長笛。當我練習的時候，有時幾乎快暈倒了！",
      9: "有一年過萬聖節，我和弟弟打扮成中國歷史上的武裝勇士外出街頭討糖果吃，並佩戴假劍來襯托我們的服飾。當鄰居看見我的時候說 “哇，你們的化妝打扮真的很好看啊!” 其實我已經是華人了，這還算是打扮嗎？",
      10: "幾年後，在學校小息時有兩個女同學突然對我大叫 “Hey Chink”這個種族歧視的用語。當時我感到很震驚和困惑，那一刻僵住了也不知道怎麼回應。為什麼她們會這樣對待我呢，我都沒有對她們做任何事情？",
      11: "隨着我的成長，更希望可以被其他人接納。不過家人堅持不讓我放棄中文和中國文化。但是我在想：“為什麼呢？在這裡我也用不着！”",
      12: "在大學時，有一個夏天我在教會做義工，帶領一個小合唱團。在那兒我認識了兩位來自Blackfoot Nation的原住民祖母。我發現原來她們早已經懂得我教的歌曲。",
      13: "這兩位年輕祖母在小時候就讀原住民寄宿學校，在那時候她們學了這首歌。原來她們在那裏有很慘痛的經歷，包括心身靈都被虐待。<br/>當時她們如果表現自己的文化或使用自己的語言，馬上就會被懲罰，這令我覺得非常的驚訝。",
      14: "後來當我們一起唱歌和創作音樂時，其中一位祖母的女兒加入了演奏他們文化的傳統手鼓！鼓聲非常的精彩, 看得出她打鼓的時候很喜悦。原住民即使經歷這麼多的痛苦，他們仍然百折不撓，並為自己的文化感到自豪。我開始思想 “為什麼我不為自己的文化感到自豪呢？”",
      15: "，在幾年後的夏天，有機會去我的祖國，在中國的農村山區為當地的學生教英語。當時我以為也許那些學生會期望從北美來的老師會有金頭髮和藍眼睛。因此，我將頭髮染成淺棕色，也帶上隱形眼鏡使眼睛的顔色變得淺一點。",
      16: "學生們竟然與我相處得非常好，並待我像姐姐一般，真是令我喜出望外。這是因為我懂得中文和了解中華文化。他們甚至帶我去嘗試街頭本地的美食，還請我吃了超級辣的兔肉火鍋, 讓我覺得驚喜交集！",
      17: "當我們說再見時，大家都流了很多眼淚。這一刻很感恩我懂得中文，可以讀學生寫給我的信。以前我沒有為自己的文化感到自豪，甚至想成為另一個人。這是多麼愚蠢的想法呢？原來認識我自己的文化背景會讓我領悟到我是多麽的寶貴，也讓我明白到我是誰！我是誰呢？我就是一個奇妙的傑作！"
