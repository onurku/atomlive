        1: "My name is Danny. Mommy calls me her Dear Danny Deer. <br/> I have a baby sister named Gigi.<br/>Gigi loves to play INSIDE, but Gigi is clumsy.<br/>“Let’s play OUTSIDE!” I tell Gigi.",
        2: "Before I know it, Gigi trips over her tiny toys and bumps into me! <br/>We both tumble into Gigi’s beautiful baby carriage…<br/>We slide into the kitchen…<br/>and land in a big, bright bowl of cold, creamy carrot cake batter!",
        3: "“Ouch!” I yell. Gigi begins to cry. She is the biggest crybaby I’ve ever seen!<br/>Mommy and Daddy come running into the kitchen.",
        4: "“Gigi hurt me,” I say. <br/>Gigi cries even louder. Mommy picks her up. <br/>Mommy looks at me. “Go to your room!” says Mommy.<br/>“No creamy carrot cake for you!” says Daddy.",
        5: "I go to my room. I feel sad.<br/>I think I will go for a walk.",
        6: "I stomp around the tall tree...<br/>over the big, bright brick bridge... <br/>through the great green grass...<br/>and over the puddle full of pretty pink and purple pebbles.",
        7: "I go to meet my friend, Ellie Elephant. She lives in a huge house. I knock on the door. <br/>I knock high and low. I knock fast and slow. ",
        8: "Ellie finally opens the door.<br/>“I am mad at my family,” I say. “Can I play with you?” <br/>“Sure! Let’s play!” Says Ellie. ",
        9: "We pretend to be mean, mighty monsters. <br/>We put on our crooked claws and sharp, shiny teeth. <br/>We roar loudly.",
        10: "Then we play hide and seek. <br/>I can’t find Ellie anywhere!<br/>Her house is huge. Mine isn’t.<br/>So I go to find another place that is just right for me.",
        11: "I go to Willie Wolf’s house. I knock on the door. <br/>I knock high and low. I knock fast and slow. ",
        12: "Willie Wolf finally opens the door.<br/>“I am looking for a place that is just right for me. Can I play with you?” <br/>“Sure! Let’s play!” Willie Wolf says.",
        13: "Willie’s stuff is piled everywhere. We huff. And then we puff. And we blow down a heap of hats.<br/>Then we blow down a dozen dirty, damp rubber ducks…<br/>and a tall, tipsy tower made of paper towels.  We huff and we puff until our stomachs hurt.<br/>“I need to use the restroom!” I say. ",
        14: "“It’s over there.” Willie Wolf points to a pile of shoes.<br/>I walk through striped shoes, polka dotted shoes, granny shoes. I step on big shoes, little shoes, stinky, smelly shoes and shoes with lots of holes! ",
        15: "This house is too messy! Mine isn’t. <br/>So I go to find another place that is just right for me.",
        16: "I go to Kitty’s house. Kitty is my cool cat friend. Her house looks just right for me. <br/>It’s not too big, It’s not too messy. I knock on the door. <br/>I knock high and low. I knock fast and slow. ",
        17: "Kitty finally opens the door.<br/>“Your house looks just right for me. Can I stay with you?” I ask.<br/>“Silly Danny Deer, you cannot stay here. You belong with your family. But you can come in and play. We can paint pretty pictures with this perfect paint!” ",
        18: "Splish, splash, plippity plop! <br/>We paint pretty pictures of Mommy, Daddy, Gigi and me. <br/>We paint on paper. We paint on boxes. <br/>We paint with our fingers. We paint with our toes. ",
        19: "I stare at the perfect pictures of my family. I begin to feel lonely and sad. I miss being home. So I say, “Goodbye, Kitty Cat! I am going home!” ",
        20: "I skip over the puddle full of pretty pink and purple pebbles…<br/>through the great, green grass…over the big, bright brick bridge…<br/>and into my home!",
        21: "Mmmm. I smell Mommy’s delicious, creamy carrot cake!<br/>I go into the kitchen and find my lovely family waiting for me!<br/>“Cake,” says Gigi, walking toward me with a slice of creamy carrot cake on a pink paper plate. ",
        22: "Oops! Gigi trips over her tiny toys AGAIN. <br/>The creamy carrot cake slides off the pink paper plate…<br/>and flies into the air…<br/>over the table...",
        23: "and lands right in my face!",
        24: "“Yum!” I lick the delicious, creamy carrot cake off my face.<br/>My family laughs. I laugh too.",
        25: "I love my family best of all! My home is just right for me. <br/>This is where I belong!"
